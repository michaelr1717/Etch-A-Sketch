# Etch-A-Sketch

Created an Etch-A-Sketch project that allows you to draw onto the grid. 

Features:
1. Created a hover effect that fades when your mouse goes over the grid
2. Able to resize the grid up to 100x100
3. A reset button that cleans up the grid and takes it back to the default size
4. Holding down the mouse will allow you to draw until you let go of the mouse, making it similar to pen strokes

I would like to come back and add an eraser button, and have the color of the tiles be customized
